# Psychic-Game

This is a pyschic guessing game I created for UCLA's web development bootcamp. It uses Javascript to determine the user's guess, and uses an if statement to determine if the user's choice hasn't already been chosen before it uses another if statement to determine if the guess is correct. It also increments the guessesLeft and tracks wins and losses.
